Hello,
This repository contains the code for my project where I try to use raytracing in order to render a 3d world containing a combination of objects.

These objects are categorised as either balls, or 3dObjects:
  - Balls are defined by a point and a radius.
  - 3dObjects are defined by thier .obj file.

The .obj file reader is very primitive and thus it is probably not able to read every .obj file.

To run a version of the project:
1. Have a python environment with numpy and matplotlib.
2. Enter a version folder.
3. Run the test.py file.

This wil run a predefined test for the version.

New objects can be added to the list "objects".
